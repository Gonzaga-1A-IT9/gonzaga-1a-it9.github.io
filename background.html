	<b><h2>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROBLEM</h2></b><br>
		<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;  font-size: 20px;">
		As Talikala Inc. continues their advocacy of improving the quality of life of women who are victims and survivors of sex trafficking and prostitution, what is needed to address is the fact that they need a consistent and sufficient amount of funding that will continue/sustain their advocacy indefinitely. And our project proposal focuses on combatting this specific issue. Our project proposal is important for the Talikala Inc. needs funds in order for them to operate. Without the enough funds to support their beneficiaries, the said insitution would be forced to stop operating. If not currently, in the future this issue would greatly affect the operation of Talikala Inc. As the number of their beneficiaries increases, Talikala Inc’s income from vending and selling, driving, fishing, and construction labor won’t be able to provide for their beneficiaries anymore, therefore they too should catch up and adjust their service in order to meet the needs/demands of each of their beneficiaries. Thus, this problem must be immediately addressed in order to come up with a solution to be able to consistently meet the needs of the beneficiaries of the said institution sufficiently and indefinitely, so that even as the number of beneficiaries increase through time, the said institution will be always able to meet the needs/demands of their beneficiaries. Talikala institution was born in response to the challenge of helping prostituted women and empowering them to break free from their "enslavement", hence, the goal of Talikala is to improve the quality of life of women who are victims and survivors of prostitution, sex trafficking, sex abuse, and sex exploitation. It was founded by three women of diverse backgrounds namely: American lay missionary Cindy O’Donnell, Filipina social worker Elizabeth O’Brien, and former night club dancer Felicidad Prieto, and was made/established in August 1987 and have since then worked in improving the lives of women who are victims of prostitution, sex trafficking, sex abuse, and sex exploitation, protecting and promoting their human rights.<br>

	 <b><h2>BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT</h2></b><br>
	 </p><br><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;  font-size: 20px;">
	As Talikala Inc. continues their advocacy of helping improve the life of women who are victims and survivors of prostitution, sex trafficking, sex abuse, and sex exploitation, what they need is a consistent and sufficient amount of funding that will be sustaining their advocacy indefinitely/for long term. The Talikala Inc. representatives itself mentioned that they indeed are lacking a consistent and sufficient amount of funds, wherein they are sometimes not able to provide/meet all the needs and demands of their beneficiaries. As an institution that aims to help improve the life of women who are victims of prostitution, etc., it is a must for them to be able to provide for all of their beneficiaries. Thus, this issue must be immediately addressed in order to come up with a solution to be able to consistently meet the needs of the beneficiaries of the said institution sufficiently and indefinitely, so that even as the number of beneficiaries increase through time, the said institution will be always able to meet the needs/demands of their beneficiaries.</p><br>
	<b><h2>IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM</h2></b><br>
	 </p><br><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;  font-size: 20px;">
	The Talikala Inc. institution was born in response to the challenge of helping prostituted women and empowering them to break free from their "enslavement". Hence, the goal of Talikala is to improve the quality of life of women who are victims and survivors of sex trafficking and prostitution. As Talikala Inc. continues this operation, what they need to address is the fact that they need a consistent and sufficient amount of funding that will continue/sustain their advocacy indefinitely.

	The Talikala Inc. needs funds in order for them to operate. Without the enough funds to support their beneficiaries, the said insitution would be forced to stop operating. Thus, this would lead to the downfall of their beneficiaries, with no one to take care of them, support them, and protect them. As of now, according to a data, in order to respond to the needs of their beneficiaries, Talikala Inc. mostly depends on their own labor. Through vending and selling, driving, fishing, and construction labor. While the said ways of earning money are indeed indefinite, it is sometimes not sufficient in meeting the needs/demands of their beneficiaries.

	According to a data, the Talikala institution now caters over 1430 individuals of all ages who are victims and survivors of prostitution, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse and exploitation. As the number of victims/survivors of the said issues rise, the said institution in concern will likewise need to provide for them. Thus, In order to meet the needs of all of its beneficiaries, Talikala Inc. will therefore need a consistent and sufficient amount of funding that will continue/sustain their advocacy indefinitely as their beneficiaries grows.<br>
	<b><h2>PROPOSED INTERVENTION</h2></b><br>
	 </p><br><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;  font-size: 20px;">
	Our project proposal is entitled; The Surmount Support. We believe that Talikala Inc’s issues regarding their financial stability is one of their greatest obstacles from helping and serving their beneficiaries.

	In order to resolve this issue, given our group's capabilities and the fact that the majority of people are now on the internet, we will use our Resource of Time to share and promote Talikala's advocacy on social media by creating a website in the hopes that it would reach a large number of people to be moved by the said institution's advocacy. On the “physical” side, we will use our capabilities and available resources to train the capable beneficiaries of Talikala Inc. to print t-shirts in order to at least start a small Shirt Printing firm. These would aid in generating income in order to have a consistent and sufficient amount of funding that will be continuing/sustaining the said institution’s advocacy indefinitely.

	We believe that this proposal is sustainable and is indefinite(long-term), for by creating a website promoting the said institution's advocacy and posting it on social media, we are not only reaching out to people for a limited period of time, but that website will always be accessible on the internet reaching out to people for as long as one could imagine. On the other hand, training capable beneficiaries and starting an at least small Shirt Printing firm for them to manage and the institution to own, we believe is also sustainable and indefinite for the beneficiaries itself are involved in the said project and money would be indefinitely circulating. Although little, but there is still profit.
